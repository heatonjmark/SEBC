# <center>Services Enablement Boot Camp 

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services Enablement 
Boot Camp. 

To follow the course and submit lab work, you will need to fork the
master repo to your own GitHub account, then clone it to your laptop.
Use your clone of the repo to add your lab work and commit the
changes.  You can then submit your work by pushing these changes
from your local repo and to your fork on GitHub.

The current version of GitHub allows you to paste file content
directly into a repo.  Please don't do this. Treat your GitHub repo
as a backup for your lab work and a source for everyone else to
read. 

Add your instructors as Collaborators to your fork. Collaborators
can edit the repo directly when necessary. Your instructors will
only do this to reformat your submissions or make other minor edits.
You can also add anyone else you wish as a Collaborator.

We use GitHub's Issues feature to track progress in class. For each
lab, we'll ask you to create an Issue and use it to communicate
progress (or lack of it) on your exercises. Each Issue can have one
or more Labels, which are useful to note the state of an Issue.

In a large class, it may take some time for an instructor to offer
help. When this happens, you can use the appropriaite Issue to
document your problem or question, log an error message or stack
trace, or provide other information. You then don't have to worry
about remembering details or leaving your system alone until help
is available.

We'll use GitHub Milestones to identify each Issue as a Lab or a
Challenge element. Milestones give us a quick way to check progress
for a collection of Issues. We don't have a clever use for it in
class.  In fact it probably won't make much sense until the class
is over and you can't remember the work you did and didn't complete.
Then it becomes quite useful.

Please make the following changes before you start work on the exercises. 
These modifications will better suit this week's work:
* Add collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Under `Settings -> Options`, locate the `Features` box and enable `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday (September 22) and Friday (September 23), respectively.
* Click the `Labels` button and edit your labels as follows:
    * Change `bug` to `labBug`
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `finished`
    * Change `help wanted` to `evaluated`
    * Change `invalid` to 
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Change `question` to `confused`

When the course is completed, your repo becomes a record of your
completed assignments, warts and all! You can do whatever you want
after the class; add scripts, annotate, modify as new information
becomes available -- whatever you like.
